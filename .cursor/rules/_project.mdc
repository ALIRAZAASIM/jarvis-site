# Project specific rules

Data privacy comes first, always.

All user-facing command line output should make use of emojis. Especially an initial emoji to start off the lines that depict what the line is about. Output should make use of indentation spacing to establish a visual hierarchy and aim to make output as easy to sift through as possible.

## Utilities

Any important point in our logical flows should have debug logs using the `debug_log` method from `src/jarvis/debug.py`. Avoid excessive logging to keep the logs easily readable and actionable.

## Architecture decisions

For any spec files, and architectural decisions mentioned below, any code change must either adhere to them perfectly or you should ask the user to confirm changes, which should also propagate to the specs themselves.

### Listening flow

Check [here](/src/jarvis/listening/listening.spec.md) for the full listening flow specification.

### Reply flow

Check [here](/src/jarvis/reply/reply.spec.md) for the full reply flow specification.

### Language-agnostic design

Avoid hardcoded language patterns as this assistant needs to support an arbitrary amount of different languages.

### Tool-profile separation

Tools define when/how to be used. Profiles define what to do after tools execute. Keep these concerns separate in `tools.py` and `profiles.py`.

### Tool response flow

Tools return raw data without LLM processing. Profiles handle all response formatting and personality through the daemon's LLM loop. This ensures consistent response style across all profiles.
